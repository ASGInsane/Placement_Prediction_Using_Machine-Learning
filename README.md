## Overview

Campus placement is a crucial event for students and educational institutions. Predicting placement outcomes and potential salaries can help students prepare better and institutions improve their placement strategies. This project uses Random Forest classifiers to predict both placement probability and expected salary based on various student features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes student information such as:
- Academic performance (CGPA)
- Skills
- Number of internships
- Number of hackathons participated
- Other relevant features

The dataset contains features for predicting both placement status and salary.
